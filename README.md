# Image Classification using CNN (Deep Learning)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to build a deep learning model that can accurately identify images across 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, dogs, and more.

## 📘 Overview
- Dataset: **CIFAR-10 (60,000 images)**  
- Model Type: **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
- Framework: **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Project Type: **Deep Learning / Computer Vision**

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The CNN includes:
- Convolution layers with ReLU activation  
- MaxPooling layers  
- Flatten + Dense layers  
- Softmax output with 10 classes  

The model is trained for 10 epochs and achieves ~70–80% accuracy depending on environment.
